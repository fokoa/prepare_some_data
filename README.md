# PREPARE DATA

We prepare data for future use on mini-projects. What is meant by preparing, is to do some preprocessing as data cleaning, features selection and data transformation. This is not about doing in-depth data analysis, or even focusing on preprocessing, but just making the data acceptable by a machine learning algorithm. The chosen data will  concern as well the problems of regression as the problems of classification.


## Regression problem
We have chosen four datasets for this type of problem:
	
* **regression\_problem/Fish/fish.csv** : for predicting the weight of fish. For details - [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/fish-market)
* **regression\_problem/AirQualityUCI/AirQualityUCI.csv** : for prediction of benzene concentrations using a gas multi-sensor device (solid-state) designed to monitor urban environment pollution. For details and author - [archive.ics.uci.edu](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Air+Quality)
* **regression\_problem/Housing Boston/housing.csv** : for the prediction of the median value of owner-occupied homes. For details - [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/prasadperera/the-boston-housing-dataset/data)
* **regression\_problem/Metro\_Interstate\_Traffic\_Volume/Metro\_Interstate\_Traffic\_Volume.csv** : for the prediction of the metro interstate traffic volume. For details and author - [archive.ics.uci.edu](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Metro+Interstate+Traffic+Volume)


The data that we will use later, resulting from the preprocessing are:

* **regression_problem/pre\_fish.csv**
* **regression_problem/pre\_air.csv**
* **regression_problem/pre\_housing.csv**
* **regression_problem/pre\_metro.csv**
