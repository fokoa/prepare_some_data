# PREPARE DATA
## Description
We prepare data for future use on mini-projects. What is meant by preparing do some preprocessing as data cleaning, features selection and data transformation. The chosen data will  concern as well the problems of regression as the problems of classification.
## Regression problem
We have chosen four datasets for this type of problem. To know :
* **fish.csv** : for predicting the weight of fish. For details - [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/fish-market)
* **AirQualityUCI.csv** : for prediction of benzene concentrations using a gas multi-sensor device (solid-state) designed to monitor urban environment pollution. For details and author - [archive.ics.uci.edu](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Air+Quality)
* **housing.csv** : for the prediction of the median value of owner-occupied homes. For details - [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/prasadperera/the-boston-housing-dataset/data)
* **Metro_Interstate_Traffic_Volume.csv** : for the prediction of the metro interstate traffic volume. For details and author - [archive.ics.uci.edu](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Metro+Interstate+Traffic+Volume)
